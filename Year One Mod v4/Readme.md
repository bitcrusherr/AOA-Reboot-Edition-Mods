Here's my version of the mod. Act of Aggression World War v4 - link [mega.nz]

I slowed down Cartel's superweapon slightly
improved the scout heli mini-guns and rockets for Cartel
changed the Koalitsya to have more range to compete a little with nlos-c
slightly nerfed the M1 Abrams tank, in an attempt to not make it one shot everything at lvl 3. Since my friends were steamrolling everything with just 4-5 Abrams.

I also improved the colour scheme for when not playing FFA. Now bright green and bright orange are the default starting team colours, since they're considerably more visible on the mini-map.

Warning: Cartel AI seems to behave strange and slows down the game in multiplayer, I have no idea why and it did this with the original mod as well. Maybe it's due to fire from the Valkyries causing lag or due to the THOR superweapon being super fast.

Maybe in a future update I or someone else might be able to fix it.
If anybody wants, I can make more detailed patch-notes.

Hope somebody likes my minor edits! :D:
