MOD BY KANE MCNASH on steam

Hello everyone, taking advantage of my vacations I have created a new iteration of my mod World War, named World War Year One, this new iteration is available at the following link:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=14Sn_1mWluTHo-MhIFK1mmuwQ1gMBSLN2

To install first go to:

(Your disc):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Act of Aggression\Data\ACTOFRUSE\PC\780095353

There rename NDF_Win.dat as NDF_Win-old.dat

Then in the link go to folder Mod Year One (V2.0), download NDF_Win.dat and paste it your loval folder.

To uninstall simply erase it and change NDF_Win-old.dat to NDF_Win.dat

So, what do we have for this year?

Well, there is a word document explaining every change brought to the mod, here I can say my main goal is as always to make this game more fun and challenging in the vibe of the days of the golden age of C&C, so, for starters I have made the economy stronger, not as much as V1.0 of the mod but with some price cuts you can come back from the brink even if you had a bad start.

Infantry has become cheaper and faster, you can actually mass them both for offense and defense, they still die miserably against area of effect HE but if used correctly you can actually make for excellent human wave tactics.

Most vehicles have received buffs, both to their rate of fire or some other important stats such as hitpoints, speed, firepower etc.

There are now some units which can be considered epic, for example the Abrams TUSK 2 now has 180 hps and can shoot most enemy units in one hit, of course they now also cost a lot more eg: 8000 plus upgrade kits, the B2 is another example, it costs 10000, but it has so much hps it's extremely hard to be shoot down.

Talking about planes now most of them are faster, as now they actually move like true military planes so be sure to build some and also the required AA

I discovered a way to make the Cartel SWs immune to anti-SWs and almost instantaneous, for this reason their damage and area of effect has been greatly reduced and the control platform is far more expensive, so it becomes a gamble, go SW with Cartel or invest in a 180 hps, large-area-of-attack Koalitsijya?

Chimera has some new tricks too, the Metal Storm now costs 400 bucks and is far faster, so you can try to drown your enemies with swarms of these drones heralding the future way of fighting wars. On the other hand terminators are sturdier and faster (although a bit more expensive), Pantsirs rockets shootier and the Valor has become basically a flying heavy rocket artillery, in large numbers they will rain tens of rockets over enemy bases at safe distance.

For more details check world-war-year-one-patch-notes,docx in the folder Mod Year One (V2.0), I hope you find the info there interesting.

Also, as an special bonus I have added my updated research notes in the folder if-you-want-to-mod-the-game (sorry if it's a bit messy, I didn't have time to check all typos and there may be a bit of inconcistency), if you want to mod the game that will make things a lot easier for you, although you will also need the Wargame Modding Suite.

Finally a lot of thanks to Eugen Systems and the fans who made this possible, the tools and documentation they created has helped me a lot.


Note: This mod is only for Reboot, while I have tested it with a couple of games and it has been working well so far I don't know how it may react to your hardware/software so as always use it at your own discretion.
